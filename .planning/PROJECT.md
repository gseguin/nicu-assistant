# NICU Assistant

## What This Is

A PWA that unifies clinical calculators into a single tool for NICU staff. Currently includes an infant formula recipe calculator, a morphine weaning schedule calculator, and a glucose infusion rate (GIR) calculator with interactive glucose-driven titration. Built with a shared component library, responsive navigation, and a plugin-like architecture that makes adding new calculators straightforward.

## Current State

**Shipped:** v1.11 Morphine Mode Removal — Single Source of Truth (2026-04-09) — Morphine Wean linear/compounding mode toggle removed; `morphine-wean-calculator.xlsx` Sheet1 is the sole authoritative formula (linear: previous − weight × maxDose × decreasePct); `calculateCompoundingSchedule`, `WeanMode` type, `modes` config block, and SegmentedToggle usage in Morphine all deleted; spreadsheet-parity tests locked row-by-row against Sheet1 (10 steps); AboutSheet copy rewritten; PWA at version 1.11.0; svelte-check 0/0, vitest 185/185, Playwright 47 passed / 3 skipped, 16/16 axe sweeps green.

## Core Value

Clinicians can switch between NICU calculation tools instantly from a single app without losing context, using the same trusted interfaces they already know.

### Active

## Current Milestone: v1.12 Feed Advance Calculator

**Goal:** Add a fourth clinical calculator — the Feed Advance Calculator — covering both the bedside feeding advancement view (Sheet2) and the full TPN + enteral total-kcal/kg view (Sheet1) from `nutrition-calculator.xlsx`, with spreadsheet-parity tests locked to both sheets.

**Target features:**
- Bedside feeding advancement (Sheet2): weight + trophic/advance/goal ml/kg/d inputs → per-feed volumes; trophic frequency dropdown (q4h ÷6 / q3h ÷8, default q4h); advance cadence dropdown (every feed / every other feed / every 3rd feed / twice daily / once daily, default twice daily = ÷2); IV backfill block (total fluids ml/hr − enteral/3 → IV rate)
- Full nutrition / TPN mode (Sheet1): TPN dextrose + SMOF + enteral → dextrose kcal, IL kcal, enteral kcal, ml/kg, total kcal/kg, auto-advance
- Registry entry, new `/feeds` route, 4th nav tab, 4th `--color-identity` OKLCH hue (4.5:1 light + dark)
- Embedded JSON config for clinical input ranges
- Spreadsheet-parity tests locked row-by-row to Sheet1 AND Sheet2
- Component + Playwright happy-path + axe-core sweeps light + dark
- Release v1.12.0

**Key context:**
- `nutrition-calculator.xlsx` is the sole authoritative source (same pattern as Morphine xlsx Sheet1)
- Sheet1 and Sheet2 likely become two modes of the calculator via SegmentedToggle — exact UX locked in `/gsd-discuss-phase`
- Trophic `/6` vs `/8` and advance `/2` in the xlsx become user-selectable dropdowns, not hardcoded

### Out of Scope

- Native app builds (Capacitor/iOS/Android) — deferred, PWA-only
- User accounts or authentication — anonymous clinical tool
- Backend/API — all data embedded at build time, no server calls
- Analytics or telemetry — clinical privacy concerns

## Context

**Shipped v1.11** with three clinical calculators. Morphine Wean is now a single-formula calculator matching `morphine-wean-calculator.xlsx` Sheet1 exactly (linear mg reduction per step); the linear/compounding mode toggle has been removed along with all supporting code (`WeanMode`, `calculateCompoundingSchedule`, `modes` config block). GIR calculator remains stripped to its essentials (bucket grid is the sole focal point), morphine-style scroll-driven dock magnification on the GIR mobile bucket list, TypeScript 6 + @types/node 25, comprehensive a11y coverage (16/16 axe sweeps), and co-located Vitest (185/185) + Playwright (47 passed / 3 skipped) suites.
Tech stack: SvelteKit 2.57 + Svelte 5.55 (runes) + Tailwind CSS 4 + Vite 8.0 + TypeScript 6.0 + pnpm 10.33.

**Current calculators:**
- Morphine Wean: single linear formula (xlsx Sheet1 parity), config-driven defaults, dock magnification, summary card
- Formula: modified/BMF modes, 40+ brands with manufacturer grouping, redesigned empty state
- GIR: Weight/Dextrose%/Fluid-order inputs, interactive 6-bucket glucose titration, dextrose-green identity, clinical safety advisories (dextrose >12.5%, GIR >12, GIR <4)

**Architecture:**
- Calculator registry in `src/lib/shell/registry.ts` — add new calculators with one entry + one route
- Shared components in `src/lib/shared/components/` — NumericInput, SelectPicker, ResultsDisplay, DisclaimerModal, AboutSheet
- State singletons per calculator: `$state` rune + sessionStorage backup
- PWA with Workbox precaching and non-blocking update banner
- App version injected from package.json via Vite define

**Users:** NICU clinicians (dietitians, nurses, GI physicians) at point of care. Primarily mobile, one-handed bedside use. Also desktop workstations.

## Constraints

- **Tech stack**: SvelteKit 2 + Svelte 5 + Tailwind CSS 4 + Vite 8 + pnpm
- **No native**: PWA only, no Capacitor
- **Offline-first**: All clinical data embedded at build time, service worker for caching
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA minimum, 48px touch targets, always-visible nav labels
- **Clinical data in JSON**: Store calculation parameters in .json files for easier maintainability

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Responsive nav (bottom mobile / top desktop) | Standard PWA pattern; thumb zone for bedside use | ✓ Good |
| Both dark and light theme | NICU environment needs both | ✓ Good |
| Single shared disclaimer | One acceptance covers all tools | ✓ Good |
| Plus Jakarta Sans typeface | Polished, already in formula-calculator | ✓ Good |
| Plugin-like calculator architecture | Easy to add/swap calculators | ✓ Good — proved by PERT→morphine swap |
| bits-ui for headless components | Accessible primitives for Svelte 5 | ✓ Good |
| JSON config for clinical data | Easier maintainability/updates | ✓ Good |
| Co-located test files | Svelte community standard | ✓ Good |
| Title bar for info/theme buttons | Frees bottom nav for full-width tabs | ✓ Good — v1.2 |
| Dock magnification on mobile | Scroll-driven card scaling, distinctive UX | ✓ Good — v1.2 |
| Version from package.json | Single source of truth via Vite define | ✓ Good — v1.2 |
| Research before PR for new identity hues | Axe-core tuning costs more than upfront OKLCH audit (v1.5 Phase 20 Morphine pain) | ✓ Good — v1.8 GIR hue 145 passed on first sweep |
| Wave 0 latent-bug fixes before feature work | Type unions and route branches must extend cleanly before downstream phases can compile | ✓ Good — v1.8 caught `CalculatorId` + `NavShell.activeCalculatorId` gaps before DOC-01 |
| Spreadsheet-parity tests with ~1% epsilon | Clinical calculators must match source authority, with tolerance for truncated spreadsheet constants | ✓ Good — v1.8 GIR all 6 buckets pass |
| Drop ESLint from DEBT-03 in favor of `svelte-check` + Prettier only | eslint was never installed (Phase 29 noted `pnpm lint` fails with "eslint not installed"). `svelte-check` already covers TS + Svelte semantic errors, accessibility warnings, and untyped-prop lint. Prettier covers formatting. Adding ESLint + a plugin stack (typescript-eslint + svelte-eslint-parser + eslint-plugin-svelte) would introduce ~6 devDeps and a second overlapping rule source for zero additional signal on a 3-calculator PWA. The stale `"lint": "eslint ."` script will be removed. (2026-04-09 / Phase 30-02) | ✓ Good — zero-dep decision |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? -> Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? -> Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? -> Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? -> Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? -> Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
